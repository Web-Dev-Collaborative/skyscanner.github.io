## 1.1.0 - Updated linting rules

ADDED:
`use-tokens` - Added an exception for values that don't have Bpk values such as `auto` and `0` - Added an exception when using the `%` unit as these don't have Bpk replacements - This rule now supports shorthand CSS props `margin`, `padding`, `border-radius` and `border-width` for linting.
