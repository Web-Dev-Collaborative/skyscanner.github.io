## How to write a good changelog entry

1. Add 'Breaking', 'Added' or 'Fixed' in bold depending on if the change will be major, minor or patch according to [semver](semver.org).
2. Detail the changes. Write with the consumer in mind, what do they need to know. If it's patch, tell them what's changed. If it's minor, tell them what you've added and what it does for them. If it's breaking, tell them what they need to change.

Don't worry about adding the specific version number or the date. This will be done by a Backpack squad member as part of the release process.
